    <h2>Project 5: Read Emails from MS 365 Exchange Online Mailbox</h2>
    <p>This project shows the process of automating reading emails from a MS 365 Exchange Online mailbox via the MS Graph API.</p>
    <p>This was part of a bigger project to extract information from email alerts and create tickets from them in a ticketing system.</p>
    <p>An app reg is set up in Azure AD (Entra ID) and a certificate is uploaded to it.</p>
    <p>The cert is installed on the server where the scdeduled task is run.</p>
    <p>The app reg has the required permissions to read emails from the mailbox.</p>
    <p>The code snippet below shows how the cert is used to authenticate to MS Graph and read emails from a specific folder in the mailbox.</p>
    </p>
